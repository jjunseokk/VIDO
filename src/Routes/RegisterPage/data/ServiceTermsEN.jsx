                Thank you for using VIDO Services and Products ("Services"). These Terms and Conditions describe the relationship between VIDO Inc. (from now on referred to as 'VIDO') that provides VIDO services and VIDO service members (from now on referred to as 'members') or non-members and include informative information that may help you use the VIDO services.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suppose you use or subscribe to VIDO services as a member of the VIDO service. In that case, you will confirm or agree to these terms and conditions and related operational policies, so please take a moment to review them carefully.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
                <strong>Enjoy a variety of VIDO services.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                VIDO provides services that can add convenience, such as searching for information, communicating with other users, and providing content through websites and applications (apps) in the VIDO domain, including <a href={"https://vido.gallery"}>vido.gallery</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                You can freely use various VIDO services through different Internet-enabled terminals such as PCs and mobile phones, and details of individual services can be easily found in the information, notices, and help from the VIDO Web Customer Center (from now on referred to as the "Customer Center").
            </p>
            <p>
                VIDO provides you all with the same content. However, due to special needs in providing related laws such as the Youth Protection Act or other individual services, some use may be restricted, such as varying the contents, hours, and number of services users provide based on age or grade. Details can also be found in each service's information, announcements, and customer center help.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
                <strong>
                    If you sign up as a member, you can use the VIDO service more conveniently.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                After reading and agreeing to these Terms and Conditions, you may apply for membership. VIDO will complete the membership process and grant you a VIDO service usage account (hereinafter referred to as the "Account"). An account refers to a member identification unit set by a member to manage the history of using various services that a member uses after logging in to the VIDO service. Members will be able to use a wider variety of VIDO services through their accounts.
            </p>
            <p>
                VIDO also grants group member accounts so that various members of the organization can use the VIDO service together under a joint account. Group members share one account and ID but log in to the account and use various services by entering their password. Group members consist of managers and members, and managers are delegated authority from all members to represent group members and operate group member accounts.
                <br/>
                Therefore, administrators can agree to separate or existing terms and conditions or withdraw from group membership through group member accounts, and manage (including deleting posts) the use of VIDO services such as logging in to group member accounts and posting posts. In principle, the provisions of these Terms and Conditions apply to all members, and each member is jointly responsible for the use of the service through the group member account and ID of other members.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please check the account operation policy and the introduction of the COVIDO group member (group ID) in the customer center for details on the authority and (joint) responsibility of managers and members in the group member account.

                <strong>We will treat the content you have provided with great care.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                VIDO expects your posts to be delivered to other users through the VIDO service, enriching our lives. A post refers to a variety of content or files consisting of signs, letters, voices, sounds, pictures, photos, videos, links, etc. posted on the VIDO service for the purpose of making others or themselves see it.
            </p>
            <p>
                VIDO promises to protect content that expresses your thoughts and feelings. Of course, you have the right to intellectual property rights and other rights to the posts you produce and post.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, in order to legally deliver your posts through the VIDO service, you need permission to save, duplicate, modify, send, display, distribute, and create secondary works (limited to translation).
                <br />
                Posting gives VIDO those rights, so you should have the necessary rights.
            </p>
            <p>
                VIDO will exercise its right to use content only in order to expose, utilize, operate, improve, and develop new services that comply with legal obligations such as web access, search, collect, and link on external sites, as provided by copyright law and other relevant laws.
                <br/>
                If you are forced to use your content for any other purpose, we will explain it to you in advance and get your consent.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, valuable content provided by you can be used by VIDO and its affiliates for research and development purposes, such as artificial intelligence technology to improve VIDO services and provide new VIDO services. VIDO will do its best to provide more convenient and useful services through continuous research and development.
            </p>
            <p>
                VIDO is committed to providing a variety of means to make it easier for you to manage the use or access of VIDO or other users to the content you provide. You can directly control other people's use or access if management functions such as content deletion and non-disclosure are provided within the VIDO service, and you can also request actions such as deleting, non-disclosure and excluding search results through the customer center.
                <br/>
                However, it may be difficult to process deletion or non-disclosure in some VIDO services. And please check this information in the information, notices, and customer center help on each service.

                <strong>Protect your personal information preciously.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                For the smooth provision of services, VIDO collects and uses personal information only within the purpose and scope agreed by members and manages it safely in accordance with laws and regulations related to personal information protection. Any efforts or other details that VIDO makes to process relevant personal information for users and members safely can be found in the Personal Information Processing Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suppose you do not have a history of logging in or accessing the service for some time. In that case, VIDO may destroy or detach your information by e-mail, in-service notifications, or other appropriate electronic means and may force you to terminate the service.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
                <strong>Respect the rights of others.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Your inadvertent posting may infringe on other people's copyrights or infringement of rights such as defamation. To solve the problem, VIDO operates a post-suspension request service based on the Act on Promotion of Information and Communication Network Utilization and Information Protection, etc., and the Copyright Act.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, using other people's content through the VIDO service does not mean that you have intellectual property rights to that content. In order for you to use the content freely, you need to pay special attention because it is within the scope of permission in accordance with relevant laws such as copyright law, or you need to obtain separate permission from the intellectual property owner of the content.
            </p>
            <p>
                VIDO permits you to use the relevant software that accompanies the VIDO service so that you can fully use the VIDO service. In this case, please note that your free use is permitted only to the extent that it meets the terms of use set forth by VIDO, and these rights are not transferable, and non-exclusive terms and legal notices apply.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
                <strong>
                    There are several caveats regarding the use of the VIDO service.

            </p>
            <p>
                VIDO is committed to ensuring you can use VIDO services freely and conveniently. However, we need your help and cooperation in order for you to use the VIDO service more safely and for the rights of you and others to be respected and protected by each other. In order to ensure your safe use of the service and the protection of your rights, we ask for your confirmation and compliance, as your posting or use of the VIDO service may be restricted in the following cases.

            </p>
            <p>
                â€¢ Posts posted using the functions of VIDO services, such as using automated means, and posts that do not match the purpose of each VIDO service may cause inconvenience to other users and further hinder the smooth delivery of VIDO services. For more information on other restricted posts, please refer to each service's post-operation policy, terms and conditions, and operation policy.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                â€¢ Any content or file consisting of signs, letters, voice, sound, pictures, photos, videos, links, etc., shall not be inserted by automated means in the area where the advertisement is placed on the VIDO service. In addition, you may not copy or modify the VIDO service or the software included therein, and you may not sell, transfer, lend, or provide it as collateral or allow others to use it. Inverse design, attempt to extract source code, duplicate, disassemble, mimic, or otherwise modify the software included in the VIDO service is also prohibited (but subject to its terms, if applicable, open source). Other than that, uploading viruses or other malicious code or abnormal use of service functions to interfere with the smooth operation of the VIDO service is also prohibited.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within these Terms and Conditions, VIDO provides stable and smooth service usage by providing post-operation policies, terms and conditions, guidance on each service, notices, and customer center help.

                    If you are forced to restrict the use of the service, follow reasonable procedures.

            <p>
                VIDO promises to treat your content with a variety of information and opinions. Still, if your post violates the relevant laws, these terms and conditions, terms and conditions of each individual service, you may be closed, deleted, or refused to publish. However, VIDO is obligated to review only some content.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, if you do not comply with the relevant laws, these terms and conditions, account and post-operational policies, and each individual service may be subject to your actions, such as requiring caution or suspending the use of the VIDO service in part, all, etc. On the other hand, despite these restrictions, if it is no longer possible to expect the full maintenance of the VIDO service usage contract, we can inevitably terminate the usage contract with you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suppose you have to restrict your use of the service. In that case, we will comply with the above step-by-step service restriction principle except for cases where urgent risk or damage is required as a clear violation of laws or infringement of other people's rights. Please note that if the service is forced to be permanently suspended due to obvious violations of laws and regulations, all points and other benefits obtained through the service will be extinguished and will not be compensated separately. Please refer to the account and operation policies for each service for the conditions and details of the service usage restriction.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
                <strong>VIDO will be responsible for the fault of VIDO.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                VIDO compensates you for any damages caused by VIDO's intention or negligence in using the VIDO service in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations. However, VIDO is not responsible for damages caused by VIDO's inability to provide services due to natural disasters or equivalent force majeure or the inability to use the service due to the user's intention or negligence.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, even if VIDO is liable for damages, special damages, indirect damages, or other punitive damages caused by unpredictable or special circumstances are not usually borne unless otherwise specified in the relevant laws.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, VIDO is not responsible for any damage caused by the exchange of opinions or transactions between you and other members through the VIDO service or by trusting the contents of others posted on the service unless there are special circumstances.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
                <strong>You can cancel the VIDO service contract at any time.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                It is unfortunate for VIDO, but members can apply for the termination of the VIDO service contract at any time and withdraw from the membership. In this case, VIDO will handle it without delay as prescribed by related laws and regulations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon termination of the VIDO service contract, all member data, including all posts attached to the member's account, will expire within 30 days and will not be recoverable unless VIDO can retain the member's information per relevant laws and privacy policies. However, even in this case, posts such as posts that have been separately captured or clipped by other members and comments registered on the public bulletin board will not be deleted, so please delete them before applying for termination and leave.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
                <strong>Some VIDO services include advertising.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                When you use a variety of VIDO services, some individual services sometimes include ads. You will be responsible for any data communication charges that may arise from using the VIDO service, and you will also be responsible for any additional expenses incurred by viewing the included advertisement.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may need to view unwanted ads to use the VIDO service you want. This contributes to providing you with a variety of VIDO services, in principle, free of charge, and further provides a foundation for VIDO to invest in research and development to serve you better. This is supported by the recent practice that some services from other companies emphasize the use of advertising-free services and provide main services for a fee.
            </p>
            <p>
                VIDO will always consider and improve how to minimize unintended inconvenience or burden.

                VIDO is committed to providing stable services 24 hours a day, 24 hours a day, but if there are significant reasons, such as maintenance, replacement, or failure of information and communication facilities such as computers and servers, all or part of the service may be discontinued.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, VIDO may modify, change, or terminate all or part of the service if there is a significant need for service operation or improvement. If all or part of the free service is modified, changed, or terminated, no compensation shall be paid unless otherwise provided for in the relevant statutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this case, VIDO will inform you long before it is predictable, and if it is unpredictable, we will explain and guide you in detail without delay. And in the event of a service outage, we'll give you a reasonable and sufficient opportunity to back up your own content.
